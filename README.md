One of the long-standing features of Animal Crossing returns in New Horizons on Switch: the Turnip Market (otherwise known as the Stalk Market). It is still one of the most productive ways to make a ton of Bells in a short span of time, but like the real stock market, it’s not without risks. 


## [BUYING AND SELLING TURNIPS ON SWITCH, EXPLAINED](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/20/21181835/selling-turnips-stalk-market)

> Every Sunday morning, a wandering vendor named **Daisy Mae** will appear around your town square. Daisy Mae will sell you Turnips, but the price is *variable*. One week she may be selling them for 100 Bells, but the next week she may be selling them for 150 Bells.

> You can buy as many Turnips as you want (as long as you have enough money). Once you have the Turnips, the idea is to sell them for **more** than you paid.

> Every day (not including Sunday), **Timmy and Tommy in Nook’s Cranny** will tell you the current price of Turnips. The price actually changes twice a day (once at *midnight*, once at *noon*).

> An example: Let’s say you bought **100 Turnips** from Daisy Mae for *100 Bells each*. You’ve made a 10,000 Bell investment. Now if Timmy and Tommy happen to be buying Turnips for 150 Bells each, selling them your Turnips will net you 5,000 Bells in profit.

> These numbers can scale up into the hundreds of thousands of Bells, resulting in some enormous paydays.

> But there’s always a risk of taking a big loss. If you buy at 100 Bells per Turnip and the Nook’s Cranny price never goes above 50 Bells, you’re going to take a loss. That’s just the way it goes.

> **Important:** Whatever you do, do not hold onto the Turnips until the following Sunday. When Daisy Mae arrives in your town again, the Turnips you bought the following week will be spoiled and worthless. Taking a 50% loss with a bad Nook’s Cranny price is better than losing the whole investment.

> **Important thing 2:** You can’t use house storage to store Turnips. If you go *HARD* on Turnips, you’re likely going to have to fill a room (or rooms) with them.
